## How can I change the currency for my account?

We do not permit users to change the currency of the account. If you registered as a Tutor and reside in a different nation than the one your Acahelp account was created in, and are presently located in the country of your residence, please contact our [support team](mailto:support@acahelp.net) so we can assist you further.

## How are you calculating exchange rates?

Acahelp uses a country-specific price tier matrix to determine a user's localized price. You can see the price tier matrix [here](#).  The matrix will be updated weekly based on market conditions.
